      <p class="lead"> A better implementation of the Can-I-Eat-This as an android app. My friends and I are currently working on improvising it. The current functionality is that apart from letting the user if a food can be eaten in a particular condition, it will also give a list of recommended foods and calulate the nutrients and micronutrients, vitamins and chemicals a food is composed of based on the recommendation engine developed in Ruby. </p>

            <p class="text-justify"> Based on Garmin's <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/">connectIQ</a> my friend and I developing an app that read's a user's heart rate as an input and determines if the person is in danger and sends out an SOS alert. The higher heart rate is associated with higher levels of stress. A user friendly option of turning off the app while working out would be provided. </p>
